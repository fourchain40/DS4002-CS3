# DS4002-CS3
# Sports Viewership Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on the viewership of major American sports leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL) using double exponential smoothing. We aim to understand how viewership trends have evolved post-pandemic and whether each league has returned to pre-pandemic levels.

## Software and Platform

### Software:
- **Python 3.8 or higher**

### Required Packages
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Statsmodels**: To implement the double exponential smoothing model.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the analysis.

### Platform:
- The project was developed and run on **MacOS** but should be compatible with **Windows** and **Linux** systems as well.
